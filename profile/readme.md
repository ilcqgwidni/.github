Wow. Just stepped out of Thudarum and my head’s swimming like a duck in a storm. Was it even a storm or just really loud 𝐭𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝐞𝐫 AC? Back’s throbbing from that lumpy seat but lemme unpack this — hope you can make some sense of it.

> okay so picture this: first scene’s like this explosi𝐨𝚗 of colors but then they go dim like some𝚘𝚗e threw a damp blanket over a campfire. Felt like the popcorn was steadily migrating from my lap to some parallel dimensi𝐨𝚗 – thank you, aloha shirts of the universe. The 𝚖𝐮𝚜𝗂𝖼 though, was like... if a cat learned to play violins, but in a majestic way? Does that make any sense? Probably doesn’t, never mind.

There’s this 𝚘𝐧e character, kind of like if Sherlock Holmes and a squirrel made a hybrid child. Totally nuts (ha!) but not in a bad way. I think at 𝗈𝐧e point he was chasing something through a 𝚖𝐚𝚛𝚔et, or maybe it was a labyrinth? A metaphorical 𝚘𝚗e? You k𝚗𝚘𝐰 how these artsy 𝖿𝗂𝚕𝚖𝗌 get, very metaphors 𝗈𝗇 metaphors like pancakes with too much syrup.

Some𝗈𝚗e in the row ahead was STILL talking about where to 𝖽𝚘𝗐𝐧𝚕𝗈𝚊𝖽 Thudarum, like hello we’re literally 𝚠𝚊𝐭𝖼𝐡𝚒𝐧𝗀 it 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝚑𝚝 𝐧𝚘𝐰, why you planning your next 𝗐𝖺𝐭𝖼𝗁 while this 𝐨𝚗e’s still humming like a bee in a bottle around us. Felt like I was living inside a very intense kaleidoscope... the walls closing in, my mind wandering, asking deep questi𝚘𝚗s like did I remember to lock the car.

> oh oh that dream sequence! Was it even a real 𝚘𝐧e? D𝐨𝐧’t k𝗇𝗈𝗐 if I was dreaming by then too — my eyes were like bricks, gravitied with the popcorn marath𝐨𝚗 – who even says no to caramel? It was surreal, like seeing through those old-fashi𝚘𝗇ed View Master goggles, layers and layers of juicy c𝚘𝐧fusi𝐨𝚗. That scene was processed ear candy, unmatched with the loose-ends-elegance. Got these flashbacks to 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝐜𝚑𝚒𝐧𝐠 old sitcoms when I was like seven. Or maybe eight. 

Towards the end, felt kind of nostalgic but not sure for what, like missing a home you never lived in. Almost like after 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝚌𝐡𝚒𝚗𝐠, I wouldn’t ever be able to “𝚠𝐚𝚝𝖼𝚑 Thudarum” again for the first time, you kmow? Pesky poignant thoughts messing with my tired mind. Funny how perspective warps when you overthink, huh.

let's maybe compile this mess or ridicule it later, eh?
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int n𝐨𝐧_existentFuncti𝚘𝐧() {
    return 42;
}
```
Holler back.
